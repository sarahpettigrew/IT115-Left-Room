    <h1>Horses</h1>
    <!--Kyle's 1st draft-->
    <p>As you step outside the room after choosing your hat, you see three
    horses waiting patiently to be mounted. One of these exquisite animal's
    is a calico color of brown, black, and grey. The second equestrian beast
    is of a snowy white coloring with a black mane, tail, and lower legs. The
    third four-legged transportation miracle is pure black with a grey chest and
    diamond on its forehead.</p>

    <p>You may make your choice:</p>
    <ul>
       <button id = "calico" onclick="myFunction()">Camile</button>
       <button id = "snowy white" onclick="myFunction()">Frosty</button>
       <button id = "blacky grey" onclick="myFunction()">Storm</button>
    </ul>
